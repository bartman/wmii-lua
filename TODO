If you have any suggests I am happy to add them to the list.

for 0.2 release
    - core
        - version number in the files
        - 'make release' target

for 0.3 release
    - core
        - rewrite timer handling using select loop and coroutines 
          and a subprocess to do iread() ... see doc/event-loop
        - support for "raw mode" like win-space in wmii+ruby
        - add wmii.load_plugin("name") which works harder to locate a
          plugin file
        - resize windows/columns with Mod1-[+-] or Mod1-Ctrl-[hjkl]
        - action and program history (bring up the last X choices in
          Mod1-a and Mod1-p)

    - bundled plugins
        - mpd: controls / volume
        - acpi: battery life / thermal
        - cpufreq: cpu freq / governor
        - whereami: wireless / controls
        - history: 
            - Mod1-[oi] to provide window history
            - Mod4-[oi] to provide workspace history (vim inspired)

future
    - core
        - bundle xclipboard functionality (add a core/x11.so)
        - make wmii.load_plugin() support multiple api versions
        - Mod1-; will display a "execute lua code here" command line
          - it would be nice if it tab completed
        - Mod1-[ and Mod1-] to push/pop windows off a stack in a hidden
          tag

    - bundled plugins
        - 'session_manager'
            - remember where windows are, and restart the "session" as
              it was before
            - global and per-view
        - 'messages'
            - add action or hot-key to copy last message to xclipboard
