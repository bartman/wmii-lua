If you have any suggests I am happy to add them to the list.

for 0.2 release
    - core
        - version number in the files
        - 'make release' target

    - bugs
        - Mod1-a wmiirc will fail if you don't have ~/.wmii-3.5/wmiirc;
          it should also look in system files

for 0.3 release
    - core
        - support for "raw mode" like Mod4-space in wmii+ruby
        - resize windows/columns with Mod1-[+-] or Mod1-Ctrl-[hjkl]
        - action and program history (bring up the last X choices in
          Mod1-a and Mod1-p)

    - bundled plugins
        - mpd: controls / volume
        - acpi: battery life / thermal
        - cpufreq: cpu freq / governor
        - whereami: wireless / controls
        - history: 
            - Mod1-[oi] to provide window history
            - Mod4-[oi] to provide workspace history (vim inspired)

future
    - core
        - bundle xclipboard functionality (add a core/x11.so)
        - make wmii.load_plugin() support multiple api versions

        - Mod1-; will display a "execute lua code here" command line
          - it would be nice if it tab completed

        - tags starting with '@' are reserved for internal use and don't
          display on /lbar
        - Mod1-[ and Mod1-] to push/pop windows off a stack in a hidden
          tag @stack

        - figure out a better way for wmiirc to remap function in
          wmii.lua;
          - an option would be to give each function a name (be it an
            event, key-binding, or action) and make them usable from
            either so people could bind a function ring_my_bell() to an
            event, key, or action.  Maybe...
                wmii.bind_event ("ring", wmii.h_ring_my_bell)
                wmii.bind_key ("Alt-r", wmii.h_ring_my_bell)
                wmii.bind_action ("ring", wmii.h_ring_my_bell)
            it should really make no difference how the action was
            invoked.  We could let the handler function know *how* with
            a parameter that wmii.lua passes to it.

        - improve logging
          - use file in ~/.wmii-3.5/ like wmii+ruby

    - bundled plugins
        - 'session_manager'
            - remember where windows are, and restart the "session" as
              it was before
            - global and per-view
        - 'messages'
            - add action or hot-key to copy last message to xclipboard
