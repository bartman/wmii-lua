This xmodmaprc script applies to the US layout of the PC104 keyboard.

It remaps keys such that:

        - Caps_Lock generates a Control_L key code
        - Control_L generates Super_L key code

Super_L generates Mod4 (the Windows key).

This is particularly useful on keyboards, like the one in my Thinkpad
X41, that don't have a Mod4 (Windows) key, which wmiirc-lua relies on.

To install it, copy the file to ~/.xmodmaprc, and run xmodmaprc from
~/.xsession.
