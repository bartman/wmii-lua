This is a lean and mean implementation of wmiirc in lua.  The goals of
the project are:
  - be fast, small, and feature rich,
  - avoid threading and polling at costs, and
  - replicate the functionality of wmii+ruby.

More details on my blog:
 - see http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/wmiirc-in-lua

Requirements:
 - wmii, 3.5+ or whatever is in hg at the moment
 - libixp, latest
 - lua5.1
 - liblua5.1
 - liblua5.1-posix0
 - patience (no, it's not a package)

Installation instructions:
 - install lua5.1 liblua5.1-posix0
   - on Debian you can do this to install all of lua5.1:

       apt-cache search lua5.1 | awk '/liblua5.1/ { print $1 }' \
       | xargs sudo apt-get install -y

 - build an install wmii from mercurial (3.5 or newer), you will also
   need libixp:

     hg clone http://www.suckless.org/hg.rc/libixp
     hg clone http://www.suckless.org/hg.rc/wmii

 - install the wmiirc script:

     make install

 - make .xsession execute wmii

Note:
 - my configuration uses Mod4 (the Win key on PC keyboards) for
   switching between work spaces and retagging.  If your keyboard does
   not have a Win key, you can execute the xmodmaprc-mod4 from your
   xsession: 
     xmodmaprc .wmii-3.5/xmodmaprc-mod4
