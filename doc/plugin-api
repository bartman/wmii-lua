About

... TODO: quick blurb about the plugin api.

Version Check

  The API will be versioned with a X.Y version that is not at all tied to the 
  version of the wmiirc-lua release.  The meaning of the version
  components is as follows:

  - X, the API major version number, distinguishes incompatible versions.
  - Y, the API minor version number, identifies minor improvement.

  When the API is changed such that it adds functionality without causing 
  compatibility issues with existing scripts, then the Y is incremented.

  When the API components are modified in a non compatible way, or
  functionality is removed/replaced, then Y is reset to ZERO and X is
  incremented.

  To check what API version your installation is using run:

    $ grep api_version core/*.lua plugins/*.lua

  In order for a plugin to be accepted by the runtime, the following
  conditions must be met:

  - the X components of the API versions of the plugin and wmiirc-lua
    must match
  - the Y component of the plugin's API version must be less than or equal 
    to the Y component of the wmiirc-lua's API version.
