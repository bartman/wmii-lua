About
======
wmii tracks several things about each X client window.  wmiirc-lua goes
a bit further and can set different modes on each client.  The modes are
tracked on a per client (aka window) basis and do not influence other
clients.  Currently the following modes are supported:

  - raw mode - bypass wmii key-bindings for selected programs
  - suspend mode - send SIGSTOP when unfocused, SIGCONT when focused

Modes can be toggled on and off by using Mod1-f shortcut.

The mode of the current window is displayed on the wmii status bar.
When all modes are disabled the widget will show -- indicating that all
available modes are disabled.  The dashes will be replaced with the
first character of the mode when that mode is enabled for the current
client.  For example: r- would indicate that raw mode was enabled, but
suspend mode was disabled.


raw mode
=========
Raw mode is tracked for each client, and can be either on or off.  When
a focused client has raw mode enabled all input except for Mod4-space is
passed to the application and not wmii.  Otherwise, all wmiirc-lua
key-bindings are handled as expected.

Raw mode can be entered using Mod4-space or Mod1-f (and selecting raw),
but can only be disabled by Mod4-space.  Note that you can also switch
focus with the mouse to regain key-bindings.

suspend mode
=============
Suspend mode is tracked for each process (ie the PID), and can be either
enabled or disabled.  When a client with suspend mode enabled loses
focus, it is sent the STOP signal -- essentially suspending the process.
Any time that a client whose process was previously suspended gains
focus, it is sent the CONT signal.

Suspend mode can be toggled bu using Mod1-f (and selecting suspend).
