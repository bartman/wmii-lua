About
======
wmiirc-lua bundles some plugins with the distribution and this document
briefly describes each.  The plugin files themselves are located in
~/.wmii-3.5/plugins/ and are documented in more detail through comments.

browser
========
  This plugin adds two actions (alt-a):

    - "browser" - passes argument or clipboard contents to browser.
    - "google" - passes argument or clipboard contents to browser as a
      search query.

  This plugin currently requires that you have xclip utility installed.

clock
======
  Adds a widget named, 999_clock, which puts it at the right most
  location.  Clock is driven by a timer which fires once a second by
  default.  Both timer tick and clock format can be set in wmiirc.

loadavg
=======
  Reads /proc/loadavg to display load average

messages
=========
  Processes 'msg' events and sends them to the middle of the bar.  This
  can be used by external tools to generate events for wmii.

  Example:

    tail -f /var/log/messages | xargs -n1 wmiir xwrite /event msg


battery
=======
  Monitor percentage of battery capacity remaining in bar.  Supports warning on
  low and critical status, and display of multiple batteries.
