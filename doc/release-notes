About
======
This file lists steps that I use to release the project.  It is probably
not of interest to you. :)

Branches
=========
    master   - current development stream
    release  - last stable release
    debian   - changes for debian packages
    pu       - proposed updates

 Development will occur on 'master', releases will be pushed out on 'release',
 and any (experimental) patches not yet in 'master' will be put on 'pu'.

Base release     (master -> release)
=============

 VERSION="0.2"

 git checkout -f release
 git merge master
 git tag -s v$VERSION                           # enter description
 
 git push

Debian release   (release -> debian)
===============

 VERSION="0.2"
 DEBVERSION="${VERSION}-1"

 git checkout -f debian
 git merge v$VERSION

 dch -v $DEBVERSION

 git commit -m"debian $DEBVERSION" debian/

 git push



vim: set ts=8 et sw=8 tw=72
