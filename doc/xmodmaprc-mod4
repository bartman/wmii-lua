! I have a Thinkpad X41.  It has no Mod4 (the Win key), but I want to use
! a second modifier for wmii.  This configuration does the following:
!
! * CapsLock generates a Control keycode
! * Left Control generates Mod4
!
! The CapsLock feature is dropped altogether.
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Super_L
add Control = Control_L
