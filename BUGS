- convert repo to build debs using git-buildpackage

10:57 < dave0> bartman: 'make deb' gives me wacky errors on wmiirc-lua
10:57 < dave0> This package has a Debian revision number but there does not seem to be
10:57 < dave0> an appropriate original tar file or .orig directory in the parent directory;
10:57 < dave0> (expected wmiirc-lua_0.2.1.orig.tar.gz or wmiirc-lua.git.orig)
10:57 < dave0> continue anyway? (y/n)

- figure out what to do with libixp... maybe release a more recent libixp.deb myself

11:07 < dave0> then it aborts claiming I don't have libixp installed
11:07 < dave0> which I installed from source per the instructions, not from apt-get
11:07 < dave0> is there a way to override that?
11:08 < dave0> dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libixp
11:08 < dave0> debuild: fatal error at line 987:
